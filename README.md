The auction simulator we made is mostly working, with a few minor bugs. You create just one Bank, and one Central Server. You can make as many Agent/House Clients as you want. Follow the prompts in the Agent Applications only, as the House Clients require no I/O. 

Known Bugs and Issues:

1)The Timer is not fully functioning right now, possibly fixed soon though.

2)The User Interface is confusing and messy.

3)The Bank does not communicate perfectly with the Central Server.

!!NOTE!!
-When making a new Agent, you input your name, then "Make Account", then the same name, then "Register", then your name one last time, then the key given to you in the output, then "View Houses". That order is very important at this point.
